# US-weather-data
R code to generate database of weather information for the US pulled from public sources, and for running some basic analysis. The resulting data set is formatted as tidyverse-compatible data frames (tibbles).

weather_sandbox.Rmd - literate programming descriptions and definitions of the functions used to generate weather data set and CSV files. 

The data set generated by this code contains monthly normals for the average Tmin and Tmax values for every month for each of the ~30,000 zip codes in the US (based on a weighted averaging of weather stations in or near the zip code).
The monthly normals data can be used to generate a temperature profile by location (i.e., temperature vs. date for a particular zip code).

The code can also generate sunrise and sunset times for each zip code for every day of thr year. Daylight savings time is not taken into account in this data. 

The "location" of a zip code is defined as the geographic centroid of the polygon that surrounds the zip code, for purposes of this work.
